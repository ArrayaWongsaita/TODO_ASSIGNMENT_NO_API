# How to Check Your Score

1. Run Your Frontend Project
   - Make sure your frontend is up and running so that all tests can interact with the application.

2. Install Dependencies for folder spec

     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. Run the Test Script
   - Execute the test commands:
     ```
     npm run test
     ```
   - Cypress will run the tests against your local frontend.

4. View Your Score
   - After the tests complete, open the file named `__test-report__.md` in your project directory to see your final score and test results.
